## Usage
Using OverlapJs in your TypeScript project is straightforward:

1. Create a container element where you want the overlapping to happen. In this element, add a top div and a bottom div.
```html
<div class="overlap-container">
    <div class="overlap-bottom"></div>
    <div class="overlap-top"></div>
</div>
```

2. Import the library:
```typescript
import { Overlap } from 'overlap-js';
```

3. Create an instance of Overlap and specify the config object:
```typescript
 new Overlap({
    container: '.overlap-container',
    topElement: '.overlap-top',
    bottomElement: '.overlap-bottom',
    overlapStyle: {
        backgroundSize: 'cover',
        backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat',
        backgroundImage: 'url(https://source.unsplash.com/random/300Ã—300?nature)'
    },
    overlapClass: 'bg-purple'
});
```
